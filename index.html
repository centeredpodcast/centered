        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>One of the greatest challenges facing the world, is polarization. Particularly in America, it seems people of differing political opinion cannot even agree on a standard set of facts. The purpose of this show is to inform people on political issues with educated, bi-partisan discussions. We will try our best not to let our own personal views get in the way of our vision, but perfect bi-partisanship is impossible. So, if you want to do further research for yourself, we promise to always have the sources we used in researching a topic publicly available. We have an extremely talented team, all of whom work really hard to get each episode made, so we hope you enjoy.</p>
